# BYOD – Securing and Increasing Productivity of BYOD in Classrooms

## 📌 What is this project?

**BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** is a web-based device management and monitoring system designed for use in schools or classrooms. It allows administrators or teachers to manage, monitor, and track students' personal devices that are brought to school for learning purposes.

## 🚀 Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to:

- **Secure** the use of personal devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones) in a classroom environment.
- **Increase productivity** by monitoring device usage and reducing distractions.
- **Provide real-time device management** including registration, status tracking, and activity logging.
- Help schools and institutions ensure safe and controlled use of technology in educational settings.

## ⚙️ How it Works

- **User Authentication**: The system provides login and registration functionality to ensure only authorized users can access the dashboard.
- **Dashboard**: Displays analytics and quick insights about registered devices and activities.
- **Device Management**: Users can register their devices by MAC address, update status, or delete entries.
- **Activity Tracking**: The system tracks device activity and shows online/offline status in real-time.
- **Security Page**: Includes options for administrators to implement or review security policies.
